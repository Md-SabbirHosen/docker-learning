====== dockerfile creatation ======
-> after setup the react project. to create a dockerfile , delete the node modules folder, it's optional to delete the node modules.

-> create a Dockerfile named file under the project folder.

-> in Dockerfile:

FROM node:18         //select the base image which is node and 18 is the node version.

WORKDIR /myapp       //Set the working directory

COPY . .             // Copy all project files into the container

RUN  npm install     // Install dependencies

EXPOSE 5173          // Expose the port project will run on

CMD [ "npm","run","dev" ]  
                     // Command to start the application



====== docker image creatation ======
-> run command in terminal : docker build .  
// here . represents the directory where the Dockerfile is located.

-> docker image ls      // it list the all the images 


====== Manage and run Container ======
-> create a container : docker run image_id
-> list all the running containers: docker ps
-> stop docker container : docker stop container_name
-> run the app out of the container : docker run -p 5173:5173 image_id
-> run container in detached mode : docker run -d -p 5173:5173 image_id
-> run multiple container : docker run -d -p 5174:5173 image_id


====== Usefull info of container ======
-> to see all the docker container list : docker ps -a
-> to remove container : docker rm continer_name, container_name 
-> to run a container and when command is given to stop container then container will be removed: docker run  -d --rm -p  8080:5173 image_id
-> to name a container by own choice: docker run -d --rm --name "myreactapp" -p 9000:5173 image_id
-> to start running a docker container that is already not running : docker start container_name


====== Manage docker image ======
-> create a docker image with name: "docker build -t mywebapp:01 ."
 here -t is for tagging and :01 is for image version.
-> to delete a docker image : docker rmi mywebapp:02
-> docker rmi image_id (but for this we have to delete all container under this docker image_id)

====== When we update our project ======
-> create another docker image
-> then create and run container along with the docker image with version
-> we can also create container for previous image and then main the images.
